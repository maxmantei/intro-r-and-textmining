This repository contains course materials for *Introduction to R and Textmining*.

## Course description

This course will teach you the basics of R and programming in R. It will teach how we can use R to work with data using the powerful ``tidyverse`` ecosystem. You will learn how to plot your data with the ``ggplot2`` library. Finally, we will cover the basics of text mining and working with text data in R using the ``tidytext`` package. This course is concise and we will not have the time to cover any advanced Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing. However, after this course you should be able to start your own test-data driven projects.

## Course outline

The course is split into 8 sections (plus one introduction). Note that the course comes with pre-recorded videos and it is strongly recommended to watch these in the prescribed order.

- **Section 0**: *Introduction and Set-Up*
- **Section 1**: *Objects and Data Structures I*
- **Section 2**: *Data I/O*
- **Section 3**: *Objects and Data Structures II*
- **Section 4**: *Programming Basics*
- **Section 5**: *Data transformation in the* `tidyverse`
- **Section 6**: *Plotting data with* `ggplot2`
- **Section 7**: *Basic Statistics/Econometrics*
- **Section 8**: *Working with Strings and Texts*
